Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion.

Simpson was tried for two accounts of murder in 1994. Simpson was accused of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and a restaurant waiter, Ron Goldman.\n\nSimpson was represented by a high-profile defense team, that many referred to as the Dream Team. It included famous names like Robert Shapiro, Johnnie Cochran, and Robert Kardashian.\n\nCochran was able to convince the jury that there was reasonable doubt about the DNA evidence, and he alleged misconduct by the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nThe trial lasted 11 months, and Simpson was found not guilty. Since then, it is often referred to as \u201cthe trial of the century\u201d and there have been television series, movies, and documentaries made about the trial.\n\nHowever, the families of the deceased filed a civil lawsuit against Simpson. The jury unanimously found him guilty for both deaths, and awarded the families $33.5 million for compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nMany feel the justice system prevailed 13 years later when Simpson was convicted and sentenced on robbery and weapons charges.\nGeneration:", "The following is a multiple choice question (with answers) about  professional medicine.

function with:\n- paths: A list of paths, where each path is a list of node indices\n- weights: A list of corresponding path weights\n\nFor example, if the shortest path is [0, 2, 4] with weight 10, call:\nsubmit_paths(paths=[[0, 2, 4]], weights=[10])\n"], "max_length": 2048}]
